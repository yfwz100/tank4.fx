# Tank4.fx

This is a tank game written in JavaFX. The goal of the game is to experiment with the architecture skill and the new Java 8 features.

At present, the game implements:

- the interface-based game framework.
- the basic game control of the player's tank (movement of the tank body and movement of the barrel).
- the simple AI which will aim at player when possible.
- the script-based(implemented in Nashorn JavaScript) level builder.

The future plan of the game includes a more intelligent and evolvable AI and interesting levels.

Feel free to send PULL REQEUST and any suggestions.

# Game control

`a/s/d/w` to move the main body of the tank.

`j/k` to move the barrel of the tank.
