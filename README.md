# Tank4.fx

This is a tank game written in JavaFX. The game aims to experiment with the architecture skill and the new Java 8 features.

So far, the following features have been implemented:

- the interface-based game framework.
- the basic game control of the player's tank (movement of the tank body and movement of the barrel).
- the simple AI which will make tank target at player when possible.
- the script-based (implemented in Nashorn JavaScript) level builder.

The future plan of the game includes a more intelligent and evolvable AI as well as some interesting levels.

Feel free to send me PULL REQEUST or any suggestions.
